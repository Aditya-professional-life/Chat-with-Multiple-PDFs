# LangChain PDF Chat

LangChain PDF Chat is a web application built with Streamlit and Python that enables users to engage in conversational queries on PDF documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface:** Users can ask questions about uploaded PDF documents in natural language through an intuitive chat interface.
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Utilizes PyPDF2 for extracting text content from uploaded PDF files, enabling seamless interaction with document contents.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Employs langchain NLP libraries and Hugging Face Transformers for text processing, understanding, and generating responses.
- **Environment Configuration:** Utilizes dotenv for loading environment variables securely, ensuring smooth deployment and execution.
- **Efficient Search:** Integrates FAISS for efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant document information.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit:** For building the web application and user interface.
- **Python:** Primary programming language for backend logic and NLP processing.
- **PyPDF2:** Library for extracting text from PDF documents.
- **LangChain NLP Libraries:** Custom libraries for text processing, embeddings, and conversational models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Used for advanced NLP tasks such as language understanding and response generation.
- **dotenv:** For secure loading of environment variables.
- **FAISS:** Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
